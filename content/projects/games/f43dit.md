F43dit is an [Opus Magnum](http://www.zachtronics.com/opus-magnum/) solution editing project.

There are two parts:

[OMSP](https://github.com/F43nd1r/omsp) is the solution parser, which transforms solution files into a kotlin model and vice versa.

[OMSEKT](https://github.com/F43nd1r/omsekt) contains the solution kotlin dsl and transforms the kotlin model into dsl and back again. It also contains an online solution editor hosted [here](https://om.faendir.com).
