[Charm](https://github.com/svenhjol/Charm) is a mod for Minecraft inspired by the [Quark](https://github.com/Vazkii/Quark) mod in that it is designed to enhance the vanilla game experience without compromising its gameplay style.

Charm was created by [@svenhjol](https://github.com/svenhjol). I joined the project during the update cycle for Minecraft 1.16.
