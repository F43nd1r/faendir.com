[ACRA](https://github.com/ACRA/acra) is a library enabling Android Applications to automatically send their crash reports to a report server. It is targeted to android application developers to help them get data from their applications when they crash or behave erroneously.

It was originally developed by [Kevin Gaudin](https://github.com/orgs/ACRA/people/KevinGaudin) and is vurrently maintained by me.
